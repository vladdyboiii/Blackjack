# Blackjack
A simple version of Blackjack coded in Python while I'm learning both Python and Git :)

Plays a game of 6-Deck Blackjack with a dealer and 1-6 players.

I've added my thoughts and learnings to a separate file.

Made in Python 3.10
Will need the Python environment to run, as well as the random and itertools libraries
(Possibly also needs Python 3+ for compatibility)

To Do:
Add typing to functions and methods
Separate classes and fucntions
Make a get_best_legal_hand function instead of repeating the same list comprehension statement over and over
Add proper error control
