# Thoughts and Learnings
## Purpose
I wrote this code as a way to practice what I was learning: Python. I tried to write as much as I could without looking at any guides or other online resources, but I did google when I knew there had to be some way to do something in Python even if I didn't know how to do it right then.


The code is not very pretty, nor is it really in the state I would like to have. I kinda toed the line between something quick and easy and something more complex that could be modifiable and readable and kinda failed at both.
eh ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

## What I Learned
There are a few things that I didn't know how to do in Python that I learned while writing this:
 - Using the itertools product function to create a deck by multiplying suits and ranks
 - Using defaultdict to give a default response instead of an error when searching an empty dictionary
 - Using list comprehension to get only legal hand values
 - Using any() and all() to check if a player has hit 21 exactly or busted

## Mistakes I Made
There are a few mistakes I made when writing that I corrected:
 - Not using not's and or's correctly together
 - Checking if the dealer is above 17 before checking if they were above 21
 - Using dictionaries and the .values() method incorrectly
 - Not accounting for the fact "10" is two characters
 - Not understanding range() and the non-inclusiveness of the 'stop at' value that well
 - And probably a couple more that I just can't remember that well

## Final Thoughts
Overall, I learned a lot, and had fun writing this code.
There definitely a few things I'd like to add/change but I think this is a good stopping point.
